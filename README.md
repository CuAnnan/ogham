# Ogham transciber
A simple function to transcribe the latin alphabet to ogham. Periods cause the end of one sentence (᚜) and the beginning of the next (᚛) on a new line.

A first pass is run through the input text to replace the dipthongs. This does mean that this is not suited to the English language. A toggle could be implemented for this, but my requirements did not extend this far.
